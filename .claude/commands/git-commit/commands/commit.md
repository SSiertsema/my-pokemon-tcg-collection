description: Commit and push changes with auto-generated commit messages
---

You are a git commit assistant. Your task is to commit and push changes efficiently.

## Mode Detection

Check the command arguments:

- No arguments or `--auto`: **Auto mode** (default) - commit and push immediately
- `--safe`: **Safe mode** - interactive approval flow

Also check environment variable `CLAUDE_COMMIT_MODE` if no flag provided:

- `auto` (default): Auto mode
- `safe`: Safe mode

## Step 1: Analyze Changes

Run these commands to understand what will be committed:

```bash
git status
git diff --staged
git diff
git log --oneline -5
```

## Step 2: Safety Checks

Before proceeding, verify:

1. **No secrets**: Skip files that look like secrets:
   - `.env`, `.env.*` (except `.env.example`)
   - `*credentials*`, `*secrets*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`
   - If found, warn the user and exclude from commit

2. **Branch check**: Note if on `main` or `master` branch (will warn before push)

3. **No changes**: If nothing to commit, inform user and stop

## Step 3: Generate Commit Message

Analyze the changes and generate a commit message:

1. Look at recent commits (`git log --oneline -5`) to match the repository's style
2. If no clear style, use conventional commits format:
   - `feat:` - New feature
   - `fix:` - Bug fix
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `test:` - Test changes
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

3. Keep the message concise but descriptive (1-2 sentences)
4. Focus on the "why" not just the "what"

## Step 4: Execute Based on Mode

### Auto Mode (default)

1. Stage all changes:

   ```bash
   git add -A
   ```

2. Commit with generated message (include Claude Code footer):

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   [Your commit message here]

   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

3. Check if on main/master and warn briefly, then push:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

4. Report success:
   ```
   ✓ Committed and pushed: [short hash] [message summary]
   ```

### Safe Mode (`--safe`)

1. Show the user what will be committed:

   ```
   Files to be committed:
   - modified: file1.ts
   - new file: file2.ts
   - deleted: file3.ts
   ```

2. Present the proposed commit message:

   ```
   Proposed commit message:

   feat: Add user authentication flow

   Would you like to commit with this message?
   ```

3. Use AskUserQuestion to get approval or edits

4. After commit, ask: "Push to remote?" before pushing

## Important Guidelines

- **Never force push** (`git push --force` is forbidden)
- **Never skip hooks** (no `--no-verify`)
- **Never amend** unless explicitly asked
- If push fails (e.g., remote has new commits), inform the user and suggest `git pull --rebase`
- If there are merge conflicts, stop and explain the situation
