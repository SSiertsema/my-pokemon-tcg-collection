## Overview

{{SOLUTION_NAME}} has been assessed against the **OWASP Top 10**, the globally recognized standard for web application security. This assessment identifies security concerns and provides actionable recommendations.

### What is OWASP Top 10?

The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10 represents the most critical security risks to web applications, agreed upon by security experts worldwide. Compliance with these guidelines significantly reduces the risk of security breaches.
