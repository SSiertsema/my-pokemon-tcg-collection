## A01:2021 - Broken Access Control

### Description

Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of data.

### Vulnerability Examples

- Bypassing access controls by modifying URL, application state, or HTML page
- Allowing primary key to be changed to another user's record (IDOR)
- Privilege escalation (acting as admin while logged in as user)
- Metadata manipulation (JWT, cookies, hidden fields)
- CORS misconfiguration allowing unauthorized API access

### Prevention Checklist

- [ ] Deny access by default, except for public resources
- [ ] Implement access control mechanisms once and reuse throughout application
- [ ] Model access controls should enforce record ownership
- [ ] Disable web server directory listing
- [ ] Log access control failures and alert admins on repeated failures
- [ ] Rate limit API and controller access
- [ ] Invalidate JWT tokens on server after logout

### Search Patterns

```
# Authorization checks
grep -r "isAdmin\|isAuthorized\|hasPermission\|checkAccess\|authorize"
grep -r "req\.user\|currentUser\|session\.user"

# Direct object references
grep -r "params\.id\|query\.id\|body\.id"
grep -r "findById\|getById\|where.*id"

# CORS configuration
grep -r "Access-Control-Allow-Origin\|cors("
```

### Prevention Checklist

- [ ] Classify data according to privacy laws and business requirements
- [ ] Don't store unnecessary sensitive data
- [ ] Encrypt all data in transit with TLS
- [ ] Encrypt all sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Use up-to-date and strong standard algorithms
- [ ] Store passwords with strong adaptive hashing (Argon2, bcrypt)
- [ ] Use authenticated encryption
- [ ] Generate keys cryptographically randomly

### Search Patterns

```
# Encryption usage
grep -r "crypto\|encrypt\|decrypt\|hash\|bcrypt\|argon2"
grep -r "MD5\|SHA1\|DES\|RC4"

# TLS/HTTPS
grep -r "http://\|https://\|HTTPS\|TLS\|SSL"
grep -r "HSTS\|Strict-Transport-Security"

# Sensitive data
grep -r "password\|secret\|apiKey\|api_key\|token\|credential"
```

- [ ] Segmented application architecture

### Search Patterns

```
# Security headers
grep -r "X-Frame-Options\|X-Content-Type-Options\|X-XSS-Protection"
grep -r "Content-Security-Policy\|Referrer-Policy"
grep -r "helmet\|securityHeaders"

# Debug/development settings
grep -r "DEBUG\|debug.*true\|NODE_ENV\|development"
grep -r "console\.log\|console\.error"

# Default credentials
grep -r "admin\|password\|123456\|default"
```

- Outdated or unsupported software
- Not regularly scanning for vulnerabilities
- Not timely patching or upgrading
- Developers don't test compatibility of updated libraries

### Prevention Checklist

- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Continuously inventory component versions
- [ ] Monitor sources like CVE and NVD for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Only obtain components from official sources via secure links
- [ ] Monitor unmaintained libraries
- [ ] Use automated tools like Dependabot or Renovate

### Search Patterns

```
# Package files
cat package.json
cat package-lock.json
cat requirements.txt
cat go.mod
cat Cargo.toml

# Vulnerability scanning
npm audit
pip-audit
cargo audit
```

## A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

### Description

Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected. Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response occurs when attacks are not detected in a timely manner.

### Vulnerability Indicators

- Auditable events not logged
- Warnings and errors generate unclear log messages
- Logs only stored locally
- No alerting thresholds and response escalation processes
- Penetration tests and scans don't trigger alerts

### Prevention Checklist

- [ ] Log all login, access control, and input validation failures
- [ ] Ensure logs are in a format that log management solutions can use
- [ ] Ensure high-value transactions have audit trail
- [ ] Establish effective monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Establish incident response and recovery plan
- [ ] Sanitize logs to prevent log injection

### Search Patterns

```
# Logging
grep -r "logger\|log\.\|console\.log\|winston\|pino\|bunyan"
grep -r "audit\|trace\|info\|warn\|error\|debug"

# Monitoring
grep -r "monitor\|metrics\|telemetry\|applicationInsights"
grep -r "sentry\|datadog\|newrelic"
```

## A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

### Description

SSRF flaws occur when a web application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. This allows an attacker to coerce the application to send requests to unexpected destinations.

### Attack Vectors

- Access to internal services behind firewalls
- Scanning internal ports
- Reading local files
- Accessing cloud provider metadata services

### Prevention Checklist (Network Layer)

- [ ] Segment remote resource access in separate networks
- [ ] Enforce "deny by default" firewall policies

### Prevention Checklist (Application Layer)

- [ ] Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data
- [ ] Enforce URL schema, port, and destination with positive allow list
- [ ] Don't send raw responses to clients
- [ ] Disable HTTP redirections
- [ ] Be aware of URL consistency to avoid DNS rebinding

### Search Patterns

```
# URL fetching
grep -r "fetch(\|axios\|request(\|http\.get\|https\.get"
grep -r "urllib\|requests\.get\|httpClient"
grep -r "url.*=.*req\|url.*=.*params\|url.*=.*body"

# Redirect handling
grep -r "redirect\|followRedirect\|maxRedirects"

# Internal addresses
grep -r "localhost\|127\.0\.0\.1\|0\.0\.0\.0\|::1"
grep -r "169\.254\|10\.\|172\.16\|192\.168"
```
