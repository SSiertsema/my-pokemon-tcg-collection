# OWASP Security Audit Plugin

Multi-agent OWASP Top 10 security audit for Claude Code that produces both technical and stakeholder-friendly reports.

## Features

- **Multi-agent architecture**: Three specialized agents collaborate for comprehensive analysis
- **Solution-aware**: Automatically determines which OWASP guidelines are relevant based on your solution type
- **Dual reporting**: Generates both technical developer reports and non-technical stakeholder summaries
- **Iterative validation**: Each guideline is analyzed and cross-validated before proceeding

## Usage

```
/owasp-security-audit
```

The command will first ask you to select a report language. English is the default, but you can specify any language supported by the LLM (Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, etc.).

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Discovery

The **Discovery Agent** analyzes your codebase to determine:

- Solution type (frontend, backend, full-stack, API, library)
- Technologies in use
- Which of the 10 OWASP guidelines are relevant

For example, a frontend-only application won't be audited for SSRF (A10) since there are no server-side requests.

### Phase 2: Guideline Analysis

For each relevant guideline, two agents work in parallel:

1. **Security Analyst Agent**: Deep-dives into code searching for vulnerabilities
2. **Verification Agent**: Cross-validates findings and checks for missed issues

The agents build consensus on findings before proceeding to the next guideline.

### Phase 3: Report Generation

Two reports are generated in `security-reports/`:

| Report                     | Audience     | Content                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owasp-audit-technical.md` | Developers   | Code locations, remediation steps, PoC details           |
| `owasp-audit-summary.md`   | Stakeholders | Plain language explanations, business impact, priorities |

## OWASP Top 10 Coverage

| ID  | Guideline                 | Description                                         |

## Solution Type Matrix

Not all guidelines apply to all solution types:

| Guideline | Frontend | Backend | Full-Stack | API  | Library |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- | ---- | ------- |
| A01       | Partial  | Full    | Full       | Full | Partial |
| A02       | Limited  | Full    | Full       | Full | Depends |
| A03       | XSS      | Full    | Full       | Full | Depends |
| A04       | Full     | Full    | Full       | Full | Full    |
| A05       | Headers  | Full    | Full       | Full | Build   |
| A06       | Full     | Full    | Full       | Full | Full    |
| A07       | Tokens   | Full    | Full       | Full | N/A     |
| A08       | CDN/SRI  | Full    | Full       | Full | Full    |
