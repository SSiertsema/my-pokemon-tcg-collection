# Contributing

<!--
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
Guide external or team contributors on how to contribute to the project.
Investigate: existing CONTRIBUTING.md, PR templates, code style configs.
-->

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone <your-fork-url>`
3. Set up the development environment (see [Development Setup](./development-setup.md))
4. Create a branch for your changes

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

| Type     | Pattern                | Example                        |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Feature  | `feature/description`  | `feature/add-user-auth`        |
| Bug fix  | `fix/description`      | `fix/login-validation`         |
| Docs     | `docs/description`     | `docs/api-examples`            |
| Refactor | `refactor/description` | `refactor/simplify-db-queries` |

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes with clear, focused commits

3. Write/update tests for your changes

4. Ensure all tests pass:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. Ensure code passes linting:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

## Commit Messages

<!--
Document commit message conventions.
-->

Follow conventional commit format:

```

```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(api): handle null response from external service
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```
