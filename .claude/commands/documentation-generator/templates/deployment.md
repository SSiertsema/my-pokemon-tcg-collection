<!--
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
Document how to deploy the application to various environments.
Investigate: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, CI/CD workflows, kubernetes/, infrastructure/.
-->

## Environments

<!--
List all deployment environments and their purposes.
-->

| Environment | Purpose                | URL                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |

| Staging     | Pre-production testing |                         |
| Production  | Live environment       |                         |

## Build Process

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Build Artifacts

<!--
Describe what the build produces and where.
-->

Build output is placed in: `dist/` or `build/`

## Deployment Methods

### Docker

#### Building the Image

```bash
docker build -t app-name:latest .
```

#### Running the Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="..." \
  app-name:latest
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

<!--
Describe the automated deployment pipeline.
Reference workflow files.
-->

The deployment pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/`:

1. **On PR**: Run tests and linting
2. **On merge to main**: Deploy to staging
3. **On release tag**: Deploy to production

### Manual Deployment
