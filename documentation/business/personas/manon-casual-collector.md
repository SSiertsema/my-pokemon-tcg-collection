## Scenarios

### Success Scenario

Manon is at a Pokemon trading day. A fellow collector offers her a rare holographic Charizard from the Scarlet & Violet set. She opens the app on her phone, types "Charizard Scarlet" in the search bar, and within seconds sees she doesn't own this card yet. She also sees she's at 78% completion for this set, making this card even more valuable for her collection. She confidently agrees to the trade, knowing she won't end up with an unwanted duplicate.

### Frustration Scenario

Manon tries to add cards from a new set she just bought, but the app requires her to scroll through hundreds of cards manually because there's no quick search or barcode scan option. After 10 minutes of searching for a single card, she gives up and decides to do it later - which never happens. Her digital collection becomes outdated and unreliable.
